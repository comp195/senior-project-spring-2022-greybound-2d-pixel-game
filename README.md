Product Description:  
Greybound is a 2D pixel game. Since the game is 2D, the game is played with just moving the character, not including the camera. The game consists of character movement, interaction with items and NPC's (non-playable characters), combat with various enemies, and other RPG (Role-playing games) elements. Other elements include a health bar, stamina bar, respawn mechanic and maybe more. The art style used within the game takes inspriation from various games like Pokemon and Undertale, where you use sprites. All the sprites created are originally created by the creator. The game is set in a western fictional setting during the 1800s. 

Product Components:  
Creation of this game was done with various programs. Firstly, it was created using Windows 10 and intended to use Windows 10 to run. The software used were Aseprite, Unity, and Visual Studio. Aseprite is a graphical software where you can create pixel art. This art created can be exported and used by Unity. Unity is a game engine that works along side Viusla Studio to create the game logic.
