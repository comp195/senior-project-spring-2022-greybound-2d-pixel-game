Product Description:  
Greybound is a 2D pixel game. Since the game is 2D, the game is played with just moving the character, not including the camera. The art style used within the game takes inspriation from various games like Pokemon and Undertale, where you use sprites. The game consists of character movement, interaction with items and NPC's (non-playable characters), combat with various enemies, and other RPG (Role-playing games) elements. Those other elements include a health bar, stamina bar, respawn mechanic and mayber more. All the sprites created are originally created by the creator. The game is set in a western fictional setting during the 1800s.
